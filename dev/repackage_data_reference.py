"""
Repackage the FinewebEdu-100B dataset into shards:

- each shard is ~100MB in size (after zstd compression)
- parquets are written with row group size of 1000
- shuffle the dataset

This will be uploaded to HuggingFace for hosting.
The big deal is that our DataLoader will be able to stream
the data and cache it along the way on disk, decreasing the
training latency.

NOTE: This file is meant only as reference/documentation of the
dataset preparation and it is not used during the project runtime.
